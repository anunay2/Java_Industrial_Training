1. StandUp Call - Done

2. Pseudocode  - Done

  What is a Pseudocode?
  
   Pseudocode is step by step lines
   written outline of the code.
   We can easily transcribe into a 
   Programming Language.
  
  Features of Pseudocode
    -> to describe how an algorithm should work
	-> to explain a computing process to less
	     technical users.
    -> to design code in a group setting
	
  Rules for pseudocode
  
     -> clarity is a primary goal of pseudocode
	 -> remember the purpose / objective of pseudocode
	 -> plan out the function of the algorithm
	 -> Explain what each line of program should do.
	 
  Do's and Dont's
  
  Do's
     -> use control structures
	 -> use proper naming conventions
	 -> use indentation and white spaces are the key
	 -> Keep your pseudocode simple
	 -> Keep it concise
	 
	 
  Dont's
     -> Dont make pseudocode abstract
	 -> Dont make pseudocode generalised
	 
	 
  What Pseudocode Ensure
  
    -> Make sure it is easily understood by the target audience
	-> Make sure it is translated into a computer program easily
	-> describe the entire automation process without leaving single aspect
	
  Pseudocode for Printing "Hello World"
     
	 Step-1 BEGIN
	 Step-2 DECLARE the variable x
	 Step-3 Initialiaze the variable x to "Hello World"
	 Step-4 DISPLAY x
	 Step-5 END
	 
  Pseudocode to determine student promotion based on the score
  Score is greater than 60 "Passed", otherwise "Failed"
  
   Step-1 BEGIN
   Step-2 DECLARE variable score
   Step-3 INPUT score
   Step-4 IF score greater than 60 THEN
              DISPLAY "Passed"
		  ELSE
		      DISPLAY "Failed"
   Step-5 END
   
   Difference  between Algorithm and Pseudo code
   
   Algorithms to print all the Even Numbers between
   1 and 10
   
   Step-1 : Store intial value to a variable
   Step-2 : Repeat the Steps until condition is false
   Step-3 : Check remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0
   Step-4 : print variable goto Step-2
   Step-5 : Stop
   
   
   Pseudocode to print all the Even Numbers between
   1 and 10
   
   BEGIN
      FOR value 1 to 10 Do
	    IF value modulo 2 Equal to 0 THEN
		       DISPLAY value
	    END IF
	  END FOR
   END  
	  
  Pseudocode for Fibonacci Series
  
  BEGIN
    DECLARE an integer variable N
	DECLARE an integer variable sum
	DECLARE an integer variable f1
	DECLARE an integer variable f2
	SET sum to 0
	SET f1 to -1 
	SET f2 to  1
	SET N to 50
	REPEAT N times
	    a sum= f1 + f2
		b f2 <- f1    //f1 = f2
		c sum <- f2  // f2 = sum
	    d DISPLAY sum
	END LOOP
  END
