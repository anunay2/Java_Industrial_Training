1. StandUp Call

2. Object Oriented Programming

3. Class 

4. Attributes

5. Methods

6. Object

7. Access Specifiers

        private, protected, default , public

8. Constructors

9. Encapsulation

	 has a relationship

10. Inheritance

      is a relationship


Object Oriented Programming

-> Data Security
-> real time entity
-> resusauabilty

Class 

-> blue print of an object
-> describes the state and behaviour of the object
-> it contains Attributes and methods.

Objects
  
  -> any real time entity
  -> Instance of a class
  -> new is keyword which is used for instantiating the class.
  
  
 Person
 
   name
   height
   age                         ------- Properties/ Attributes / Instance Variable
   Qualification
   Gender
   
   eat()
   walk()                      ------> Behaviours / Methods
   Speak()
   
   
   Person p1 = new Person();
   p1.name ="Saxena";
   p1.age=18;
   
   Any class with attributes and methods is termed as Java Bean or 
    POJO (Plain Old Java Objects)  or Model (MVC).
	
   Access Specifiers
   
   scope of the instance varaible are decided by access specifiers
   
   private instance variables, methods are accessible within the same class.
   protected instance variables are accessible  by sub classes of the same package
                        or sub classes of different
   default : when no acccess specifier it is called as default.
             Accessible across multiple classes of the same package
   public : accessible anywhere
           
  Constructor 
                method name which is same as class name.
				method gets called during instantion
				constructor cannot return any value
				constructor can take arguments
				constructor can be overloaded.
				when a constructor does not have any parameters
				they are called as default constructors.
				
	class Dept{
	  
	  int dno;
	  String dname;
	  
	  Dept(){}  // default constructor
	  
	  Dept(int dno, String dname) // Parameterized constructor
	  
	  
	Encapsulation :
	
	Binding of Data members and methods within the class
	 is called as Encapsulation
	 
	Relationship between the classes.

    Association : inter-dependant on each
	
	Account                                  Bank
	
	  Account No                             Bank Name
	  Account Type                           Branch
	  Account Name                           IFSC code
	
	Aggregation  has-a 
	
	Both the classes has a relationship
	One class does not exists, when other class become obsolete
	  
	  Building                               Windows
	  	   
	   Number                                  length
	   Floor                                   breadth
	   doors and windows                       height
	   
	
	Composition
	
	When 2 different classes are related to each other, One class continues
	to exists when other class becomes obsolete
	
	 School                                    Address
	 Name                                      no
	 classrooms                                stname
	 Head                                      city
	
	
	Inheritance
	
	deriving a sub class from an already exisiting class
	- modularity
	- code re-usability
	- extensibility
	
	
	Types of inheritance
	
	Single - if we derive only one sub class, then it is called single inheritance
	Multi-Level - we can go on deriving the subclass at different levels
	Multiple - deriving a sub class from two different parent class
	Hybrid  - combination Multi-level and Multiple
	
	java does nor multiple inheritance
	
	keyword: extends
	
	final
