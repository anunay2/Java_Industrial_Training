CGI - Pre-Onboarding - Java - Wave 3
Today's Learning OutCome (13/08/2020)

1. StandUp Call - Done

2. Git Operation (contd...)
   To get the repo from the remote to local
   Step-1 : Type gitlab-cgi.stackroute.in url
   Step-2 : Enter your credentails
   Step-3 : Create a New Project
   Step-4 : Select clone drop-down - https url
   Step-5 : goto Terminal if unix, or cmd if Windows
   Step-6 : select the folder for repo to be cloned
   Step-7 : In the Terminal  git clone <url>
          git clone https://gitlab-cgi.stackroute.in/Shankar/day2project.git
   Step-8 : cd repo folder
   Step-9 : create a new file
   Step-10 : git status
   Step-11 : git add .
   Step-12 : git status
   Step-13 : git commit -m "initial commit"
   Step-14 : git push origin master
   

3. Problem Solving Techniques
     Ways of Analaysing the problems
	    - Root cause Analysis : 
		                  Find the root cause for the problem
						  Treat the root cause with proper solution 
		- Fish Bone Diagram
		               All the causes leading to the Problem
					    must be noted
					  Analyse the causes to find a better
					    solution.
					  Over all look of the diagram will 
					   like Fish Bone
		 
		- 5 Whys ?
		            Raise Queries for the problem
4. Algorithms
          
What is an algorithms?

It is a finite sequence of well-defined 
		     computer-implementable instructions.
  It is a step by step procedure to solve a logical
		      or mathematical problem.
			
Process of Algorithm Development
    
	Step-1 : Obtain description of Problem
	Step-2 : Analyse the problem statement
	Step-3 : Develop a High level algorithm
	Step-4 : Refine the algorithm by adding more details
	Step-5 : Review the algorithm 
	
Characteristics of algorithms

    1) Well-defined inputs
	2) Well-defined outputs
	3) Clear and unambigous
	4) Finiteness
	5) Langauge independant
	6) Feasible

Algorithm for withdrawing money from ATM
lgorithm
Step-1 : Insert Card
Step-2 : Select Language
Step-3 : Enter 4 digit PIN
Step-4 : Enter the type of Transaction
Step-5 : Enter the amount to be withdrawn
Step-6 : Collect the cash
Step-7 : Receipt to be collected

Exercises (Will be discussed tomorrow during stand-up)
 1) Algorithm to prepare Biscuits
 2) Algorithm for Online shopping
 
 
5. Flowcharts 
   
   A pictorial represention of a program or program segment
   
   Start, End or Finish ------> Oval or rounded Rectangle
   input , output         -----> parallelogram
   Decision Making    --------> Diamond or rhombus
   Assignments, calculations ----> rectangle
   
   For Drawing flowchart we can use various tools
       google draw, Raptor
   
   url for Raptor tool installation
      https://raptor.martincarlisle.com/

   Online Raptor tools
   https://jezersek.eu.org/projects/arhiv/raptor/
   
   input - use GET (uppercase)
   output - use PUT (uppercase)
