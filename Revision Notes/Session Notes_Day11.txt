2. Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) 

3. Unified Modelling Language (UML)


Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) is a software 
engineering approach. 
It models a system as a group of interacting objects. 
Each object represents some entity in the system being modeled.
and is characterised by its class, its state (data elements), 
and its behavior. 

Object-oriented analysis (OOA) applies object-modelling techniques to 
analyze the functional requirements for a system.
OOA focuses on what the system does.


Object-oriented design (OOD) elaborates the analysis models to 
produce implementation specifications. 
OOD on how the system does it.

Generalization is a mechanism for combining similar classes of 
objects into a single, more general class. 
Generalization identifies commonalities among a set of entities. 
The commonality may be of attributes, behavior, or both. 

Specialization is the reverse process of Generalization means 
creating new sub-classes from an existing class.
